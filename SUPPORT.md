## Support for a Project of @freaktechnik

There is a fine line between a bug report and a support request. Thank you for considering that your issue may be a support request. In general, if you can point to
a specific problem, just file a bug.

If there are dedicated support channels for a project, and for some reason no SUPPORT.md, they should at least be documented in the README or be linked when you go
to file a new issue.

In case you can't locate a support channel, you can contact me by:

- Email: martin@humanoids.be
- Matrix: @freaktechnik:humanoids.be
- Fediverse/ActivityPub: @freaktechnik@chaos.social

Make sure to not only state your request, but also details on your environment, like operating system and version of the project, as well as potentially relevant
details like the language you use it in. Screenshots or videos are greatly appreciated for better illustration.

Known issues that I expect many users to hit are generally pinned in the project's issues list. If you think you're hitting such an issue but aren't sure, reference
it in your request. If you're sure you're also affected, please refrain from a "me too" comment and instead just thumbs up the issue.
